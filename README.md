# HardhatSafetyDetection

This project leverages YOLOv8 to detect safety-related items in images, such as hardhats, masks, safety vests, and the presence of persons. The main goal is to enhance workplace safety by automatically identifying compliance with safety regulations.

## Project Overview

- **Model**: YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) is used for object detection.
- **Purpose**: To detect if individuals are wearing safety equipment such as hardhats, masks, and vests in images or video.
- **Classes**: The model detects 10 classes - Hardhat, Mask, NO-Hardhat, NO-Mask, NO-Safety Vest, Person, Safety Cone, Safety Vest, machinery, vehicle.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Efficiently detects safety-related items in real-time.
- **Custom Training**: Trained on a custom dataset for enhanced accuracy in specific workplace scenarios.
- **Flexible Usage**: Can be used for both images and video streams.
